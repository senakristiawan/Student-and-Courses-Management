**# Student-and-Courses-Management**

**The Camp404 project** is meant to be a simplified example of managing courses and students within an educational system.  It provides basic functionality for adding, deleting, and retrieving information about courses and students.
Student and Courses Management is a foundation for building a more extensive educational management system or can be used as an educational exercise to understand Go programming concepts and data management.
